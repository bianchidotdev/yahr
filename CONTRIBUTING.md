# Contributing

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## How can I contribute?

If you see bugs or would like to propose a new feature, please create an [issue]() in the repo. With any bug reports, it is most helpful if you can include the type of machine you are using along with the version of the tool.

If while using the project, something is unclear, please create an issue and ask a question. Issues with documenation are issues with the tool!

For smaller changes, feel free to put up a PR if you know how to implement an issue.

For larger changes, I'd like to discuss how the change fits with the direction of the project and what implementation might look like prior to active development.

Thank you for reading through this!
